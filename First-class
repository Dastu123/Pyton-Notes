Java,C is statistically typed programming language, Every time we declare a variable we have to specify the datatype
Python is dynamic typed programing language we dont need to define the data types, while passing value to the variable python,
Dynamically assigne the datatype      

reserved keywords 33

1. all reserved words contain alphabet symbols.
2. except first 3 rest all should be lower case letters.

Datatypes.
=========
int, float, complex, bool, str, bytes, betearray, range, list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, None
Every thing in python is an object.
All the fundamental datatypes int, float, complex, bool, str are immutable
Once an object is created it cannot be modified and becasue multiple reference variables will point to the same object
example 
A=10
B=10
C=10
here 3 reference variables are pointing to the 10 object and if C can change the object then A and B can be impacted
